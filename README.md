# B-Trees
The task of this programming project is to implement an index for fast data retrieval without having to search through every row in a database table.

The task was to implement the B+Tree dynamic index structure. It is a balanced tree in which the internal nodes direct the search and leaf nodes contains record pointers to actual data entries. The tree structures grows and shrink dynamically.

It is assumed that the keys are unique integers. We simulate the disk pages using two node types and the MAX_FANOUT parameter.
